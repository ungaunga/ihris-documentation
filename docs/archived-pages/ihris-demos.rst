IHRIS Demos
===========

 **Purpose:**  To demonstrate Capacity’s GRC and HAF websites and iHRIS software at key dissemination events to generate interest/use in these products.

 **Vision:**  Individual and small groups of users learn - via a guided, interactive experience - the overall purpose of the product and a specific application of it. In other words, use from the viewpoint of key user or tied to a particular context or problem.

 **Venues:**  GRC iHRIS knowledge fair and EOP event Capacity Expo

 **Software:**  Articulate

 **Basic concept:**  Produce several short guided but interactive demonstrations of key features of iHRIS. These are intended to be self-running. The interactivity should be limited to just a few choices intended to showcase the software highlights. Beyond running these demos at events, we can also post them online.

A possible basic format:



* Tell me what I am going to learn
* What's in it for me
* Tell me (the info)
* Show me (video, screencast etc)
* Tell me again
* Tell me how to find more info

Length: 4-5 minutes each

Overlying narrative or goal to accomplish that ties all demos together...

Possible features to be showcased in interactive videos:


* Search for a person's record and maybe enter a couple of fields
* Training module - perhaps schedule someone for a training and then assess
* Report example 1 - generate staff list, show the graphing feature based on the staff list
* Report example 2 - graphical display of nurses by age or gender, set some limits
* iHRIS Plan - Create a quick projection

For #2 above, can we add a custom report showing how many staff have NOT attended a training?  This may speak to donors and central planners.  Showing how you use the training module to schedule a person for a training and track their assessment and competencies is helpful but using this data as a planning tool demonstrates the “so what” of tracking this data.

For the reports, limit by district as this is often asked.

For #3 above, possibly show person how to run report of nurses in the country, then ask person to choose how they want to "drill down" - maybe give them the options of age, gender, district.
