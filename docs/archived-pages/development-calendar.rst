Development Calendar
====================

 *Last update -- March 2009* 

The following are development goals only, not necessarily hard-and-fast deadlines, and are subject to change. Expect this calendar to be updated frequently as new priorities come up. Developers, feel free to annotate with your own goals.

Q2-Q3 2009 Goals (April-July 2009)

iHRIS Survey (Tentative Product Idea)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

iHRIS Survey would enable the user to create a form with all needed fields, enter the data into a flat database and then run reports on that data. The form could be customized to address a variety of issues: backlog data entry; a step solution to prepare and clean data before importing into the mature HRIS; enter people or facility survey data; or any other form/database needs. If approved, the first iteration can be released in Summer 2009.
