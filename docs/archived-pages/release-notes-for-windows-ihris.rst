2. ABOUT THIS SOFTWARE

The Capacity Project develops in the iHRIS Suite core solutions addressing specific issues in human resources for health (HRH) leadership. The iHRIS Suite is free and Open Source software distributed under the GPL.

iHRIS Manage is a human resources management tool that enables an organization to design and manage a comprehensive human resources strategy. iHRIS Manage helps an organization manage its workforce more effectively and efficiently, while reducing costs and data errors. Using the system, the HR professional can create a hierarchy of positions for an organization based on standard titles, job classifications and job descriptions, even spread over diverse geographic locations, offices and facilities. HR staff can solicit job applications for open positions, assign employees to fill positions and maintain a searchable database of all employees, their identifying information and their qualifications. Managers can track each employee's history with the organization, including their position and salary histories, and record the reason for departure when the employee leaves. iHRIS Manage is primarily intended to be used to manage health care workers employed by a country's Ministry of Health, a hospital or other large health care organization, or a private provider of health care services. However, it may be readily adapted to other types of organizations and workforces.

iHRIS Qualify is a health worker training, licensing and certification tracking system. The system enables a licensing or certification authority for a health worker cadre, such as nurses or physicians, to track data on the complete cadre in a country from pre-service training through attrition. The database captures information about health professionals from the time they enter pre-service training through registration, certification and licensure, and it is updated every time a professional's license or certification is renewed. This system is also capable of tracking continuing medical education attained by health workers, capturing data about foreign-trained workers applying to work within the country and recording out migration verification requests.

iHRIS Plan is planning and modeling software developed to improve how health sector planners and program decision makers plan for their health workforce needs in developing country settings. The software helps planners and decision makers model workforce needs and make effective policy decisions to meet those needs. 

Windows iHRIS provides a way to use all of these tools on a Windows computer without a Linux server. Windows iHRIS is designed to be used in locations where there is no or limited Internet access, or where it is not practicable to maintain a Linux server, such as in a facility or local government setting. Windows iHRIS may also be accessed on a local area network or over the Internet by multiple users. (Windows iHRIS was formerly titled Offline iHRIS.)


3. NEW FEATURES/BUG FIXES IN THIS RELEASE

This release is an offline companion to the iHRIS suite of human resource information systems. This release also includes all the fixes in the core iHRIS Suite 3.1.4 release.

Upgrades are now handled by the Windows iHRIS installer. It is no longer necessary to uninstall old versions of Windows iHRIS, and all data previously entered should be maintained in the upgrade.


4. REQUIREMENTS AND INSTALLATION

Windows iHRIS requires Windows XP, 500MB hard disk space and 1GB RAM. A web browser is required to run the software. Firefox 2+ (http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/) or Internet Explorer 7+ (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx) is highly recommended.

For best results, uninstall any previously installed versions of Windows iHRIS before proceeding.

Double-click the self-executing installer and follow the installation instructions to install and set up Windows iHRIS. Do not install version 3.1 in the same directory as a previous version of Windows iHRIS. Choose the default directory for fastest loading. Specify a MySQL password when prompted. If Windows Firewall is running, select the option to unblock the firewall when prompted.


5. GETTING STARTED

Windows iHRIS provides access to the standalone, single-user version of iHRIS Manage, iHRIS Qualify and iHRIS Plan. Select the program you want to run from the main menu. Please be patient as the first load of each system may take several seconds.

You will be prompted to change your password and create a non-administrator user account to get started. Consult the Help for more information.

Each program includes sample data intended for demonstration purposes. Upon first loading a system, you are given the option to load the sample data. You may choose from the following options (for iHRIS Manage and Qualify):

- base data: includes basic data lists such as marital status and countries

- medical base data: includes health-related data lists such as cadres and facilities

- sample data: dataset for the fictional country of Taifafeki, intended for demonstration purposes only

Enabling the data can take a few seconds. Please be patient while it loads.

Once loaded, the sample data can be edited. However, you should not load the demonstration sample data if you intend to enter your own data in the system.

Before starting, read the User's Manual, which can be accessed by clicking the Help button on any screen. The manual section "Before Installing the System" provides helpful worksheets for collecting the data needed to enter in the system.

To navigate among the systems, left-click the iHRIS taskbar icon in the lower right corner of your screen. To quit Windows iHRIS, right-click the icon and choose Exit.

If you have questions or need support, please visit the iHRIS Website by clicking that button on any screen and use the Contact Us form to send us your question. 


6. KNOWN ISSUES

Windows iHRIS 3.1.3 has the following known issues:

- There may be some conflicts regarding the sample, or demonstration, data. Sample data may be installed when that is not the intention of the user. If you need to work with a clean database -- in other words, you intend to use Windows iHRIS to manage your own data -- we suggest that you uncheck all of the sample data checkboxes and click the Do Not Enable Any button when prompted after the first installation.


7. ABOUT THE CAPACITY PROJECT

The Capacity Project is developing free, Open Source HRIS solutions, distributed under the GPL, to supply health sector leaders and managers with the information they need to assess HR problems, plan effective interventions and evaluate those interventions. We don't provide just software but rather a program of technical assistance and expertise to ensure that the technology is transferred effectively and serves the ability of decision makers to use data to lead and manage. Our participatory approach results in systems that are appropriate for the context in which they are used and sustainable after we leave.
