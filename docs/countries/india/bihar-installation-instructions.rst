This page contains installation instructions on installing iHRIS Manage Customizations for Bihar
== Getting Ready ==


First you should install Ubuntu and all the supporting software required by iHRIS by following the [[Linux (Ubuntu) Installation - Supporting Software]] instructions.

'''Note:''' Installing on ext4 filesystem?  see [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1313834 this]

'''Note:'''  Unless specifically mentioned, all the commands below are run using a terminal.  You can start this in Ubuntu by going to Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.  Any time a command begins with '''sudo''' it will prompt for your password because this will be run with administrative privileges.  When you run sudo multiple times, only the first time will ask for your password.

'''Note:'''  Some installation commands will prompt for inputs in the terminal window, usually with a blue background.  The mouse doesn't work to click on options here.  You can use Tab to move between options and the space bar to check or uncheck selections.

'''Note:'''  Some commands will launch the '''gedit''' file editor.  Look at the [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit documentation] if you need additional help.
