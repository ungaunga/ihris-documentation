Tanzania:CSSC Implementation
============================

The  `Christian Social Services Commission (CSSC) <http://www.cssc.or.tz/>`_ , is an umbrella group for FBOs in
Tanzania.  It has implemented iHRIS Manage in its central office to manage health-care workers.  It plans
to de-centralize the data to zonal offices, and use the central office for data aggregation, reporting and planning.
