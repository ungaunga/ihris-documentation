Health Workforce Observatories in Africa
========================================


Observatory Websites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


 ** `WHO/AFRO’s regional Africa Health Workforce Observatory (AHWO) <http://www.hrh-observatory.afro.who.int/>`_ ** 

 ** `Cameroon’s Observatoire National des Ressources Humaines en Sante du Cameroun (ONRHSC) <http://www.cm-minsante-drh.com/>`_ **  - Note the resource for individual health workers to check their own information, and even submit it, including skills and competencies! Great feature to support for iHRIS countries; our new self-service functionality will facilitate this.  You can also generate a complete list of MOH employees by department, and you can drill down to an individual record if you know the date of birth.

 ** `Malawi Health Workforce Observatory <http://www.malawihrhobservatory.gov.mw>`_ **  - This site is more nascent, with a good compendium of policy documents in the downloads section.  

 ** `Mauritania’s Observatoire National des Ressources Humaines en Sante du Mauritanie (ONRHS of Mauritanie) <http://www.onrhs.gov.mr/observatoire/>`_ **  - The key health and HRH policy documents are organized down the left hand side.  Below them, there is a clear vision for services for individual health workers.

Please add other Health Workforce Observatory websites to this list.

 ** `Report of the Global Meeting of Human Resources for Health Observatories <http://www.ihris.org/mediawiki/upload/WHO_observatories_meeting_report.pdf>`_ **  - This report summarizes the key conclusions of the Global Meeting of Human Resources for Health (HRH) Observatories: Evidence-informed Human Resources for Health policies – the contribution of HRH Observatories, which was held in Lisbon, Portugal, from 4 to 7 July 2011. It is one of the best and most recent outlines of the Observatory concept and some of the latest thinking from countries about the approach.
