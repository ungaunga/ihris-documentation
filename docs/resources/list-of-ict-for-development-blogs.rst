Tip: To keep up with blog posts, use an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed reader. This enables you to subscribe to the blog like a newspaper and read new articles from one web page or software program, without having to revisit each website separately. I recommend using [http://www.google.com/reader/ Google Reader] to subscribe to and organize your feeds ([http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9745368-2.html how to use Google Reader)], but there are [http://blogspace.com/rss/readers many other options]. You can also read RSS feeds directly in Internet Explorer or [http://thepaisano.wordpress.com/2008/05/29/how-to-add-rss-feeds-to-your-outlook/ Microsoft Outlook].
