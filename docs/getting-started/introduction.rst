iHRIS Suite
===========

iHRIS, IntraHealth International's free, open source software, helps
countries around the world track and manage their health workforce data
to improve access to services. Countries use it to capture and maintain
high-quality information for health workforce planning, management,
regulation, and training.

iHRIS is built on a flexible framework that allows ministries of health,
professional councils, and health service delivery organizations to adapt
applications for a wide variety of uses. Developed in collaboration with
national stakeholders beginning in 2005, with support from USAID,
iHRIS is used in more than 20 countries to manage over a million health
worker records at a potential cost savings of over $275 million when
compared to commercial software.

iHRIS has been developed into multiple, interoperable applications to meet
the needs of a variety of stakeholders and support health workers
throughout their life cycle
