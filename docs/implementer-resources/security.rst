Security
========

This documentation reinforces security procedures on iHRIS software. We are currently reviewing and updating this documentation. 

iHRIS uses a task- and role-based security mechanism to limit access to various parts of the system.  A user is assigned a role, and a role is a collection of tasks that the role can perform. This article describes how [[Tasks and Roles|roles and tasks]] are defined in Magic Data and used by the iHRIS system.

This article collects together the various [[Pluggable Authentication|user authentication modules]] that utilize the pluggable authentication available with version 4.0.3 of the iHRIS Suite.

Sometimes instead of restricting users by action, you may want to restrict by record-level data, specifically [[Configuring Restricted Access by Facility or Geography|by the facility or geographical location]] where the person works.
