Code Downloads
================================================

Our `main website <http://www.ihris.org/download>`_ has direct links to the latest versions of the iHRIS applications to download.

iHRIS source code is hosted on Launchpad. Current releases, code in development, and localized versions of the iHRIS software suite are all available. Launchpad is also the primary place for reporting bugs, asking questions, and contributing to the effort toÂ [[Translations|translate iHRIS]].

Reviewing the [[Technical Documentation]] is a good first step before customizing iHRIS and developing new features. All developers working on the project are invited to contribute to the documentation on the wiki and to `register as an iHRIS developer <http://www.ihris.org/developers/contribute-code/>`_.

For the main iHRIS packages, you can view and download the source code using launchpad where all our code is hosted.
