Technical Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The [[Technical Documentation|Technical Overview of iHRIS]] is the place to start with understanding how iHRIS is structured. Please read the [[Introduction and Overview]] first if you are new to working with iHRIS.

[[Technical Chats]] are led by a senior iHRIS developer each week on a different topic and archived here.

Documentation and tutorials are also available on:


* [[Security]] procedures included in iHRIS software.
* [[Interoperability|Exporting data]] for decentralized environments or sharing with other HIS
* [[Decentralized iHRIS|Using iHRIS in a decentralized environment]]
* [[Data Dictionary - iHRIS 4.1]]

We also have several tutorials for [[Implementer Resources|implementers who are administering an instance of iHRIS.]] 

Most of this documentation has been translated into [[Spanish-language Resources|Spanish]].
