==Technical Documentation==
The [[Technical Documentation|Technical Overview of iHRIS]] is the place to start with understanding how iHRIS is structured. Please read the [[Introduction and Overview]] first if you are new to working with iHRIS.

[[Technical Chats]] are led by a senior iHRIS developer each week on a different topic and archived here.

Documentation and tutorials are also available on:
* [[Security]] procedures included in iHRIS software.
* [[Interoperability|Exporting data]] for decentralized environments or sharing with other HIS 
* [[Decentralized iHRIS|Using iHRIS in a decentralized environment]]  
* [[Data Dictionary - iHRIS 4.1]]

We also have several tutorials for [[Implementer Resources|implementers who are administering an instance of iHRIS.]] 

Most of this documentation has been translated into [[Spanish-language Resources|Spanish]].


==Contributing to the Project==
Check [[Design Documents]] for descriptions of new features and applications currently under consideration for development. 

To understand our priority development needs, including core system improvements and new features or modules, please review our [[iHRIS Ideas List]].

For developers who are creating software releases or packages, we are currently revising our [[Software Release Procedure]]. 

[[Translations]] describes the process for translating the iHRIS software and enabling translations.
