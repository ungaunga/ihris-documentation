Report a Bug
============

Note: We are in the process of formalizing and documenting our bug reporting process. Currently, you can use [http://www.ihris.org/developers/bug-reports-and-feature-requests/ this form on our website] to report a bug or request a new feature for iHRIS. If you are a registered developer, you can also report bugs on [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ihris-suite Launchpad], our hosting site. You will need to create a free user account on Launchpad to report a bug.
