Interoperability
================

Having standardized data lists is useful for managing multiple systems. This could be for:

* development, testing and production servers of iHRIS
* district and national iHRIS systems in a decentralized iHRIS installation
* use by other systems that want to know what data lists are being used in iHRIS.
* exchange of data between systems

Standardized Lists
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
iHRIS Supports the following standardized lists:

* The  `ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 <http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/>`_ , or International Standard Classification of Occupations, codes from the International Labor Organization
* `ISO 3166 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1>`_  The standardized list of countries from ISO
* `ISO 639 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`_   The standardized list of languages from ISO
* `Sharing Value Sets (SVS) <http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_SVS_Rev2-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf>`_  from Integrating the Health Enterprise(IHE) is a general mechanism for sharing standardized lists between systems

Supported Standards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* [ftp://ftp.ihe.net/DocumentPublication/CurrentPublished/ITInfrastructure/IHE_ITI_Suppl_CSD.pdf Care Services Discovery (CSD)] for the exchange of health worker information, and in particular for supporting a  `health worker registry <https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/Health+Worker+Registry+Community>`_ .
* `SDMX-HD <http://www.sdmx-hd.org/>`_
* `Sharing Value Sets (SVS) <http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_SVS_Rev2-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf>`_  for standardized lists
* `DXF2 <http://folk.uio.no/bojo/sdmx/sdmxhd_doc.xhtml>`_  (DHIS2 Exchange Format)
* `DSML <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_Services_Markup_Language>`_  (Directory Services Markup Language)
