Interoperability
================

Having standardized data lists is useful for managing multiple systems. This could be for:
*development, testing and production servers of iHRIS
*district and national iHRIS systems in a decentralized iHRIS installation
*use by other systems that want to know what data lists are being used in iHRIS.
*exchange of data between systems



==Standardized Lists==
iHRIS Supports the following standardized lists:
*The [http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/ ISCO-88 and ISCO-08], or International Standard Classification of Occupations, codes from the International Labor Organization
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1 ISO 3166] The standardized list of countries from ISO
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes ISO 639]  The standardized list of languages from ISO
*[http://www.ihe.net/Technical_Framework/upload/IHE_ITI_Suppl_SVS_Rev2-1_TI_2010-08-10.pdf Sharing Value Sets (SVS)] from Integrating the Health Enterprise(IHE) is a general mechanism for sharing standardized lists between systems

==Supported Standards==
*[ftp://ftp.ihe.net/DocumentPublication/CurrentPublished/ITInfrastructure/IHE_ITI_Suppl_CSD.pdf Care Services Discovery (CSD)] for the exchange of health worker information, and in particular for supporting a [https://wiki.ohie.org/display/SUB/Health+Worker+Registry+Community health worker registry].
