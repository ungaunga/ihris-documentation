Other Health-related Open Source
================================================


Baobab
^^^^^^

The Baobab Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) System is currently used in more than ten sites throughout Malawi. It allows clients to anonymously be tested for HIV, Tuberculosis, and other diseases. Registration clerks, counselors and lab technicians enter the collected information into Baobab touchscreen systems in real time. Though counseling, referrals, and general awareness are the primary goals of any VCT centre, data collection and analysis are a close second.

Until now, Baobab has used a proprietary data model for all of the data collection. With the latest release, Baobab has developed a set of SQL scripts that allows existing VCT deployments to migrate their data to the OpenMRS data model. By registering triggers in the MySQL database the system can continue to update the OpenMRS database as the VCT data is updated. This allows site facilitators to utilize open tools for analyzing the VCT data.

Debian Med
^^^^^^^^^^

Debian-Med is a "Custom Debian Distribution" with the aim to develop Debian into an operating system 
The Community Health Information Tracking System or CHITS (www.chits.info) is an extensible, modular, open source information system for rural health units (initially for the Philippines). It collects existing routine health data from vertical programs in the Field Health Service Information System (FHSIS) and integrates them into a unified, comprehensive computerized information system.

That is particularly well fit for the requirements for medical practice and research. The goal of Debian-Med is a complete system for all tasks in medical care which is built completely on free software.

TrialDB
^^^^^^^

TrialDB is a customizable Web-based clinical trials database system used for the storage and management of clinical data. It relies on a rich data library that contains information about individual data elements (parameters, typically clinical facts about patients) and their higher-order grouping. The library is used to generate case report forms (CRF) as Web pages, and records both information used to interactively validate the contents of the CRF as well as specify how individual elements in the CRF are presented to the user.
